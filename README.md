# MC-one
Monte Carlo version of Precision Annealing

libMCone.py is the library file where the Annealer class and all its basic functions are defined. 
The goal is that anyone should be able to create/implement any simple annealing schedule/strategy with the Annealer class.

A running example of such is the annealer.py file.
